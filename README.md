What is it ?
A very light weight media server that can run on a Raspberry Pi zero 2 w up to a Raspberry Pi 5.
version 4.3 onwards has the onboard wifi as an access point that the pi routes network traffic through to the ethernet port as well as hosting minidlna, cockpit, samba and apache onto both networks

What does it run ? 
Samba for local network accees,
Cockpit for web based remote administration of the server,
Minidlna - for local streaming to smart devices like TV's,
Apache - for web based access and streaming the media through a web browser (or through a web browser on a phone).
Media Scraper: Automatically pulls movie posters and synopses daily at 5 AM.
Auto-Conversion: A background service that converts MKV files to MP4 at midnight to ensure compatibility with all streaming devices.

So what does it look like ?

I like it, how do I install it ?
The installer and all config files are contained in the zip folder which makes it easier just to install on a raspberry pi with one command ( copy and paste):-

wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diddy-boy/mini-pi-media-server/main/install.sh | bash

so what is in the zip file ?
All images, config files and web files.

How do I install manually ?
download the pi-setup.zip file and then unzip the file in your Raspberry home directory (normally a user called pi)

cd into pi-setup folder

You will be presented with three shell scripts and three folders
Just run 'sudo ./mini-pi-setup.sh'

this will install all software and place all config files into their relevant folders
the user will be asked for a Samba password and if they want to set up a wifi to connect to along with an access point name and password.
yes the raspberry pi can become a hotspot as well when away from the home network.
the user is then asked if they want to set up a timed syncronisation from a local server and if they want to disable swap space

What are the other scripts ?
Rotating-server-sync.sh - Pull down the most recent media from a home server in the past xx months. the user can set how many months to pull down
reconfigure-wifi.sh - set up which wifi network to connect to and also set up an access point and password for when the mini pi server is away from home
Configure-server-sync.sh - users can set up a timed sync service to always sync media from and set a time to syncronise every day.
mkv-2-mp4.sh: Handles the batch conversion of media files to ensure they play smoothly on web browsers and older smart TVs.
scraper.py: A Python-based tool that uses DuckDuckGo and BeautifulSoup to find metadata for your media library.
network-verification-tool.sh -  tool to show the wifi card and network setup. will show access point name, password etc

I borked it, how can I fix it ?
run the command to download and install again :-

wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diddy-boy/mini-pi-media-server/main/install.sh | bash

if that fails, run this :-

wget -qO main.zip https://github.com/diddy-boy/mini-pi-media-server/archive/refs/heads/main.zip && unzip -o main.zip && cd mini-pi-media-server-main && unzip -o pi-setup*.zip && cp -rf pi-setup ~/ && cd ~ && rm -rf mini-pi-media-server-main main.zip && cd ~/pi-setup && chmod +x ./*.sh && sudo ./mini-pi-setup.sh
